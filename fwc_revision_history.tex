\begin{itemize}
\item Name changed to ForwardCom.
\item Moved to github.
\item Various security features added.
\item Support for dual stack.
\item Some instruction formats modified, including more formats for jump and call instructions.
\item System call, system return and trap instructions added.
\item New addressing mode for arrays with bounds checking.
\item Several instructions modified or added.

\subsubsection{Version 1.01, 2016-05-10.}
\begin{itemize}
\item The instruction set is given the name CRISC1.
\item The length of a vector register is stored in the register itself. The basic code structure is modified as a consequence of this. Function calling conventions are also simplified as a consequence of this.
