\chapter{Test suite}
A suite of test is provided for testing all instructions and formats. 
\vv

The test programs are written in ForwardCom assembly for the purpose of self test of emulator and softcores.
\vv

The source code for the test programs are available at:\\
\href{https://github.com/ForwardCom/test-suite}{github.com/ForwardCom/test-suite}
\vv

The following test programs are available so far:
\begin{itemize}
\item tests\_arithmetics.as: Test all integer arithmetic instructions
\item tests\_bool\_bit.as: Test all boolean and bit manipulation instructions
\item tests\_branch.as: Test all jump, call, and branch instructions
\item test\_formats.as: Test all integer instruction formats
\end{itemize}
\vv

Test programs for vector instructions and floating point instructions are not available yet.
\vv

The test programs must be assembled and linked with the library libc.li for testing on the emulator or full-featured softcores. Use libc-light.li instead of libc.li for the softcore with limited capabilities and no system calls.
