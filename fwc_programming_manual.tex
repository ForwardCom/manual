\chapter{Programming manual}\label{chap:programmingManual}
This manual is based primarily on the assembly language syntax described in chapter \ref{chap:assembler}.
Instructions for other programming languages should be described in the manuals for the respective compilers.
\vspace{2mm}

\subsection{Code and data sections} \label{codeDataSections}
All code must be placed in executable sections. Data can be placed in read-only sections or
writeable sections. Read-only sections are used for constants and tables. Function pointers
and jump tables should preferably be placed in read-only sections for security reasons.
Variables can be placed in writeable data sections, on the stack, or in registers.
\vspace{2mm}

Numeric constants can be included in the instruction codes. This will reduce the pressure on the data cache.
\vspace{2mm}

\subsection{Register use} \label{registerUse}
There are 32 general purpose registers r0 - r31, and 32 vector registers of variable length v0 - v31.
r31 is the stack pointer. r0 - r27 can be used as general pointers. r28 - r30 can be used as pointers
with no offset or with a scaled offset of no more than 8 bits. r0 - r30 can be used as array indexes.
r0 - r6 and v0 - v6 can be used as masks. r0 - r30 and v0 - v30 can be used as fallback values.

\vspace{2mm}
The use of registers in function calls must obey the function calling conventions described in chapter \ref{chap:functionCallingConventions} and the regster usage conventions in chapter
\ref{chap:registerUsageConvention}.
\vspace{2mm}

\subsection{Addressing of data} \label{AddressingOfData}
All addresses of code and data should be relative. Pointer tables should use addresses 
relative to a reference point such as \_\_ip\_base, \_\_datap\_base, the beginning of the table,
or a reference point near the targets. The relative addresses may be scaled by a power of 2. 
64-bit absolute addresses should be avoided.
\vspace{2mm}

\subsection{Special address symbols} \label{SpecialAddressSymbols}
The following symbol names are defined by the linker:

\begin{longtable} {|p{28mm}|p{12mm}|p{95mm}|}
\caption{SpecialSymbols} 
\label{table:specialSymbols}\\
\endfirsthead
\endhead
\hline
\bfseries Name & \bfseries Base & \bfseries Meaning  \\
\hline
\_\_ip\_base & ip & The linker will place this symbol where read-only data ends and code begins. 
It is possible to explicitly place this symbol elsewhere in an ip-addressable section.\\
\hline
\_\_datap\_base & datap & The linker will place this symbol where writeable data ends and uninitialized data begins. 
It is possible to explicitly place this symbol elsewhere in a datap-addressable section.\\
\hline
\_\_threadp\_base & threadp & The linker will place this symbol at the beginning of thread-local data. 
It is possible to explicitly place this symbol elsewhere in a threadp-addressable section.\\
\hline
\_\_program\_entry & ip & This symbol must be specified. It marks the first instructions to execute. 
This must be a startup code that makes any necessary initialization and then calls \_main.
The library forwc.li includes a suitable startup code that will be included automatically
if \_\_program\_entry is not defined elsewhere.\\
\hline
\_\_event\_table & ip & Table of event handler records.\\
\hline
\_\_event\_table\_num & constant & Number of event handler records.\\
\hline
\end{longtable}

\vspace{2mm}

\subsection{Event handlers} \label{EventHandlers}
You can specify event handlers for all the events defined in the file elf\_forwardcom.h.
An event handler consists of a function to be called when the event occurs, and a record
defining the event. The event record must contain the following fields:

\begin{longtable} {|p{20mm}|p{15mm}|p{100mm}|}
\caption{Event record structure} 
\label{table:EventRecordStructure}\\
\endfirsthead
\endhead
\hline
\bfseries Name & \bfseries Size & \bfseries Meaning  \\
\hline
functionPtr & 32 bit & Pointer to the event function relative to \_\_ip\_base, scaled by 4.\\
\hline
priority    & 32 bit & If there are more than one handler for the same event then the ones with
the highest value of priority will be called first. 
Normal priority = 0x1000.\\
\hline
key         & 32 bit & Subdivision of event. This can define a hotkey, menu item, or icon id for user command events.\\
\hline
event       & 32 bit & Event ID. Possible values are defined in the file elf\_forwardcom.h.\\
\hline
\end{longtable}
\vspace{2mm}

The linker will make a table of all the event handler records, sorted by event, key, and priority.
\vspace{2mm}

The event function uses register r0 as status. The function should 
return a value of 1 in r0 in the normal case. The function can return 0 in r0 to bypass further 
event handlers with lower priority.
\vspace{2mm}

r1 can be used for further parameters. r2 can point to a zero-terminated string.
\vspace{2mm}

The following example shows an event handler for the event EVT\_CONSTRUCT (= 1), initializing some data.

\begin{example}
\label{exampleEventHandler}
\end{example} % frame disappears if I put this after end lstlisting
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]

// section for event handler records only
events section read ip event_hand
int32 (init_func - __ip_base) / 4, 0x1000, 0, 1
events end

// data section
data section read write datap
somedata: int64 0
data end

// code section
code section execute ip
init_func function
int64 r1 = 5
int64 [somedata] = r1 // initialize somedata to 5
int64 r0 = 1          // return status = 1
return
init_func end

\end{lstlisting}
\vspace{4mm}

You can create an event by calling the function \_call\_event in the library forwc.li.
This function will search the table of event records for an event with the specified 
event and key number and call all corresponding event handler functions.
\vspace{2mm}

The table of events cannot be changed while the application is running. 
A module or library that is added by dynamic linking while the application is running
cannot add new event handler records.
\vspace{2mm}

\section{Code examples}\label{chap:codeExamples}

This section contains examples of assembly code to illustrate the features of the ForwardCom instruction set.
The syntax for assembly language is described in chapter \ref{chap:assembler}.
The function calling conventions are described in chapter \ref{chap:functionCallingConventions}.
\vspace{2mm}


\subsection{Horizontal vector add} \label{horizontalVectorAdd}
ForwardCom has no instruction for adding all elements of a vector because this would be a complex instruction with variable latency depending on the vector length.
\vspace{2mm}

The sum of all elements in a vector can be calculated by repeatedly adding the lower half and the upper half of the vector. This method is illustrated by the following example, finding the horizontal sum of a vector of single precision floats. 

\begin{example}
\label{exampleHorizontalAdd}
\end{example} % frame disappears if I put this after end lstlisting
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
v0 = my_vector              // we want the horizontal sum of this
int64 r0 = get_len(v0)      // length of vector in bytes
int64 r0 = round_u2(r0)     // round up to nearest power of 2
float v0 = set_len(r0,v0)   // adjust vector length
while (uint64 r0 > 4) {     // loop to calculate horizontal sum
   uint64 r0 >>= 1          // the vector length is halved
   float v1 = shift_reduce(r0,v0) // get upper half of vector
   // the result vector has the length of the first operand:
   float v0 = v1 + v0       // Add upper half and lower half
}
// The sum is now a scalar in v0
\end{lstlisting}
\vspace{4mm}


\subsection{Horizontal vector minimum} \label{horizontalVectorMin}
The same method can be used for other horizontal operations. It may cause problems that the set\_len instruction inserts elements of zero if the vector length is not a power of 2. Special care is needed if the operation does not allow extra elements of zero, for example if the operation involves multiplication or finding the minimum element. A possible solution is to mask off the unused elements in the first iteration. The following example finds the smallest element in a vector of floating point numbers:

\begin{example}
\label{exampleHorizontalMin}
\end{example}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
v0 = my_vector             // find the smallest element in this
r0 = get_len(v0)           // length of vector in bytes
int64 r1 = round_u2(r0)    // round up to nearest power of 2
uint64 r1 >>= 1            // half length
v1 = shift_reduce(r1,v0)   // upper part of vector
int64 r2 = r0 - r1         // length of v1
float v0 = set_len(r1,v0)  // reduce length of v0
// make mask for length of v1 because the two operands may 
// have different length
int64 v2 = mask_length(r2, v0, 0), options=4
// Get minimum. Elements of v0 fall through where v1 is empty
float v0 = min(v0, v1, mask=v2, fallback=v0) // minimum
// loop to calculate the rest. vector length is now a power of 2
while (uint64 r1 > 4) {
   // Half vector length
   uint64 r1 >>= 1
   // Get upper half of vector
   float v1 = shift_reduce(r1, v0)
   // Get minimum of upper half and lower half
   float v0 = min(v1, v0)  // has the length of the first operand
}
// The minimum is now a scalar in v0
\end{lstlisting}
\vspace{4mm}


\subsection{Switch-case statement} \label{switchCase}
A switch-case multiway branch can be implemented efficiently with a table of relative addresses.
This table is placed in read-only memory for security reasons.
\vspace{2mm}

\begin{example}
\label{exampleSwitchCase}
\end{example}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
/* C code:
int i, x;
switch (i) {
case 1:
   x = 10;  break;
case 2:
   x = 12;  break;
case 5:   
   x = 20;  break;
default:
   x = 99;  break;
}
*/
// ForwardCom code:

rodata section read ip
// table of relative addresses, using DEFAULT as reference point
align (4)
jumptable: int16 0            // case 0
int16 (CASE1 - DEFAULT) / 4   // case 1
int16 (CASE2 - DEFAULT) / 4   // case 2
int16 0                       // case 3
int16 0                       // case 4
int16 (CASE5 - DEFAULT) / 4   // case 5
rodata end

code section execute ip
// r0 = i
// r1 = x
// test if i is outside of the range
// use unsigned test to avoid testing for r0 < 0
if (uint32 r0 > 5) {
   jump DEFAULT
}
int64 r2 = address([jumptable])
int64 r3 = address([DEFAULT])
// relative jump with r3 = DEFAULT as reference point,
// r2 as table base and r0 as index
int16 jump (r3, [r2 + r0 * 2])

CASE1:
   int32+ r1 = 10
   jump FINISH
CASE2:
   int32+ r1 = 12
   jump FINISH
CASE5:
   int32+ r1 = 20
   jump FINISH
DEFAULT:
   int32+ r1 = 99
FINISH:

code end
\end{lstlisting}
\vspace{4mm}


\subsection{Boolean operations} \label{BooleanOperations}
Boolean combinations of conditions can be implemented with branches as shown in this example.
\vspace{2mm}

\begin{example}
\label{exampleBooleanOperations1}
\end{example}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
/* C code:
float condfunc (float a, float b) {
   if (a >= 0 && (a < 20 || a == b)) {
      a = sqrt(a);
   }
   return a;
}
*/

// ForwardCom code:

code section execute ip
extern _sqrtf : function

// v0 = a, v1 = b
_condfunc function public
if (float v0 >= 0) {
   if (float v0 < 20) {jump L1}
   if (float v0 == v1) {
      L1:
      call _sqrtf
   }
}
return  // return value is in v0
_condfunc end

code end
\end{lstlisting}
\vspace{4mm}

Branches can be quite slow, especially if they are poorly predictable. 
It is often faster to generate boolean variables for each condition and use bit operations to combine them. 
This corresponds to replacing \&\& with \& and $\vert\vert$ with $\vert$. 
The code below shows the same example where three conditional jumps are reduced to one conditional jump and two bit operations.
Note that this transformation is not valid if the evaluation of unused conditions has side effects.

\begin{example}
\label{exampleBooleanOperations2}
\end{example}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
_condfunc2 function public
float v2 = v0 >= 0     // boolean variable for a >= 0
float v3 = v0 < 20     // boolean variable for a < 20
float v4 = v0 == v1    // boolean variable for a == b
int32+ v3 |= v4        // a < 20 || a == b
int32+ v2 &= v3        // a >= 0 && (a < 20 || a == b)
if (float v2 & 1) {    // test bit 0 of boolean v2
   call _sqrtf
}
return
_condfunc2 end
\end{lstlisting}
\vspace{4mm}

We can reduce the number of instructions and make the code still faster by using
a special feature of the compare instruction that uses the mask and fallback registers
as extra boolean operands:

\begin{example}
\label{exampleBooleanOperations3}
\end{example}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
_condfunc3 function public
float v2 = v0 >= 0     // boolean variable for a >= 0
float v3 = v0 == v1    // boolean variable for a == b
// use mask and fallback register as extra boolean operands
float v4 = compare(v0, 20), options=0x22, mask=v2, fallback=v3
if (float v4 & 1) {    // test bit 0 of boolean v4
   call _sqrtf
}
return
_condfunc3 end
\end{lstlisting}
\vspace{4mm}


\subsection{Virtual functions} \label{virtualFunctions}
Virtual functions are used in C++ for polymorphous classes.
This example shows how to implement a virtual class in ForwardCom.
We can save space by using 32-bit relative pointers rather than 64-bit absolute pointers as other systems do.
\vspace{2mm}

\begin{example}
\label{exampleVirtualFunctions}
\end{example}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
/* C++ code:

class VirtClass {
public:
   // constructor:
   VirtClass() {x = 0;}
   // virtual functions:
   virtual void func1() {x++;}
   virtual int  func2() {return x;}
protected:
   int x;
};

int test() {
   VirtClass obj;      // create object
   obj.func1();        // call virtual function 1
   return obj.func2(); // call virtual function 2
}
*/

// ForwardCom code:
rodata section read ip align = 4
// table of virtual function pointers for VirtClass
// with REFPOINT as reference point
VirtClasstable:
int32 (VirtClass_func1 - REFPOINT) / 4
int32 (VirtClass_func2 - REFPOINT) / 4
rodata end

code section execute ip
// choose any reference point for the relative pointers, 
// for example the beginning of the code section:
REFPOINT: nop

VirtClass_constructor function public
// The pointer 'this' is in r0
// At [r0] is a relative pointer to VirtClasstable,
// next the class data members, in this case: x
int32 r1 = VirtClasstable - REFPOINT
int32 [r0] = r1
int32 [r0+4] = 0
return
VirtClass_constructor end

VirtClass_func1 function
// The pointer 'this' is in r0
// x is in [r0+4]
int32 r1 = [r0+4]
int32 r1++
int32 [r0+4] = r1
return
VirtClass_func1 end

VirtClass_func2 function
int32 r0 = [r0+4]
return
VirtClass_func2 end

_test function public
push (r16)       // save register
// get the address of the reference point
int64 r16 = address([REFPOINT])
// the object 'obj' uses 8 bytes, allocate space on the 
// stack for it
int64 sp -= 8
// call the constructor. The 'this' pointer must be in r0
int64 r0 = sp
call VirtClass_constructor
// r0 still points to the object because a constructor 
// always returns a reference to the object.
// Get the address of the virtual table
int32 r1 = sign_extend_add(r16, [r0])
// call VirtClass_func1 as the first table entry
int32 call (r16, [r1])
// get a pointer to the object again
int64 r0 = sp
// Get the address of the virtual table
int32 r1 = sign_extend_add(r16, [r0])
// call VirtClass_func2 as the second table entry
int32 call (r16, [r1+4])
// release space allocated for 'obj'
int64 sp += 8
pop (r16)        // restore register
// the return value from callVirtClass_func2 is in r0
return
_test end

code end
\end{lstlisting}
\vspace{4mm}


\subsection{Memory copying} \label{memcpy}
The standard memcpy function can be implemented efficiently as a vector loop.

\begin{example}
\label{exampleMemcpy}
\end{example}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
// C function:
// void *memcpy(void *destination, const void *source, size_t n);

_memcpy function public
// r0 = destination
// r1 = source
// r2 = n
int64 r3 = r0 + r2           // end of destination
int64 r1 += r2               // end of source
// the type int32 has the longest maximum vector length
// make vector loop with vector of int32
for (int32 v0 in [r1-r2]) {
   int32 v0 = [r1-r2, length = r2]  // read from source
   int32 [r3-r2, length = r2] = v0  // write to destination
}
// destination is returned unchanged in r0
return
_memcpy end   
\end{lstlisting}
\vspace{4mm}


\subsection{High precision arithmetic} \label{highPrecisionArithmetic}
Function libraries for high precision arithmetic typically use a long sequence of add-with-carry instructions for adding integers with a very large number of bits. A more efficient method for big number calculation is to use vector addition and a carry-look-ahead method. The following algorithm calculates A + B, where A and B are big integers represented as two vectors of n$\cdot$64 bits each, where n \textless{} 64.
\vspace{2mm}

\begin{example}
\label{exampleHighPrecisionArithmetic}
\end{example}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
uint64 v0 = A                // first vector,  n*64 bits
uint64 v1 = B                // second vector, n*64 bits
uint64 v2 = carry_in         // single bit in vector register
uint64 v0 += v1              // sum without intermediate carries
uint64 v3 = v0 < v1          // carry generate = (SUM < B)
uint64 v4 = v0 == -1         // carry propagate = (SUM == -1) 
uint64 r0 = get_len(v0)      // length of vector in bytes
uint64 v3 = bool2bits(r0,v3) // compressed to bitfield
uint64 v4 = bool2bits(r0,v4) // compressed to bitfield
// calculate propagated additional carry:
// CA = CP ^ (CP + (CG<<1) + CIN)
uint64 v3 <<= 1              // shift left carry generate
uint64 v2 = v2 + v3 + v4
uint64 v2 ^= v4
uint64 v1 = bits2bool(r0,v2) // expand additional carry to vector
uint64 v0 += v1              // add correction to sum
uint64 r0 >>= 3              // n = number of elements in vectors
uint64 v3 = gp2vec(r0)       // copy to vector register
uint64 v2 >>= v3             // carry out
// v0 = sum, v2 = carry out
\end{lstlisting}
\vspace{2mm}

If the numbers A and B are longer than the maximum vector length then the algorithm is repeated. If the vector length is more than 64 * 8 bytes then the calculation of the additional carry involves more than 64 bits, which again requires a big number algorithm.

\subsection{Matrix multiplication} \label{matrixMultiplication}
Matrix operations can be difficult because they involve a lot of permutations. The following example shows the multiplication of two $4\times4$ matrixes of floating point numbers, assuming that the vector registers are long enough to contain an entire matrix.
\vspace{2mm}

\begin{example}
\label{exampleMatrixMultiplication}
\end{example}
\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
float v1 = first_matrix          // first matrix,  4x4 floats
float v2 = second_matrix         // second matrix, 4x4 floats
int64 r1 = 64                    // size of entire matrix in bytes
int64 r2 = 1                     // shift count, elements
int64 r3 = 4                     // shift count, elements
float v0 = replace(v1,0)         // make a matrix of zeroes
for (int64 r0 = 0; r0 < 4; r0++) { // repeat 4 times
   float v3 = repeat_within_blocks(r1,v1,16) // repeat column
   float v4 = repeat_block(r1,v2,16)         // repeat row
   float v0 = v0 + v3 * v4       // multiply rows and columns
   float v1 = shift_down(r2,v1)  // next column
   float v2 = shift_down(r3,v2)  // next row
}
// Result is in v0.
\end{lstlisting}
\vspace{2mm}
You may roll out the loop and calculate partial sums separately to
reduce the loop-carried dependency chain of v0
\vspace{2mm}



\section{Optimization tricks}
\label{OptimizationTricks}

The ForwardCom system is designed with high performance as a top priority. The following guidelines may help programmers and compiler makers obtain optimal performance.

\subsubsection{Minimize instruction size}
The assembler will automatically pick the smallest possible version of an instruction. 
Instructions can have different versions with 4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, and 64-bit integer constants. 
A large integer constant with few significant bits can be represented as a smaller constant with a left shift. For example, the constant 0x5000000000 can be represented as 5 $<<$ 36. The assembler will do this automatically when possible.
Small floating point constants with no decimals can be represented as 8-bit signed integers. Simple rational numbers where the denominator is a power of 2 can be represented as half precision without loss of precision. The assembler does this automatically, too.
It is recommended to check the output listing from the assembler to see 
how much space each instruction takes. Sometimes, you can reduce the instruction size by simple changes in the code. Many instructions will be smaller if the first source register is the same as the destination register. You can also see from the output listing if there are unpaired tiny instructions that can be paired if you reorder the instructions.

\subsubsection{Optimize jumps}
The assembler will merge a jump with a preceding arithmetic instruction if possible, unless optimization is turned off. For example, an integer addition followed by a conditional jump that compares the result with zero may be merged into a single instruction. This is only possible when a number of conditions are fulfilled: 
\begin{itemize}
\item the two instructions have the same data type
\item the destination of the arithmetic instruction is the same register as the source of the branch instruction
\item the arithmetic instruction uses the same register for source and destination
\item there are no other instructions between the two, and no jump label.
\end{itemize}

The output listing will show if the two instructions have been merged.
\vspace{2mm}

Optimization of jumps to jumps, etc., is generally the responsibility of the compiler. The assembler will do only a few simple jump optimizations.


\subsubsection{Optimize cache use}
Memory and cache throughput is often a bottleneck. You can improve caching 
in several ways:

\begin{itemize}
\item Optimize code caching by minimizing instruction sizes, pairing tiny instructions, and inlining functions.
\item Optimize data caching by embedding immediate constants in instructions.
\item Use register variables instead of saving variables in memory.
\item Use registers as function parameters.
\item Avoid spilling registers to memory by using the information about register use in object files, as described on page \pageref{chap:registerUsageConvention}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Use general purpose registers for control code}
Any variables that control program execution, such as branch conditions and loop counters, should preferably be stored in general purpose registers rather than memory or vector registers. This may enable the microprocessor to resolve branches early and prefetch the code after the branch earlier.


\subsubsection{Use the vector loop feature}
Array loops are particularly efficient if the vector loop feature described on page \pageref{vectorLoops} is used. Loops containing function calls can be vectorized if the functions allow vector parameters.

\subsubsection{Avoid long dependency chains}
ForwardCom may be implemented on a superscalar processor that can execute multiple instructions simultaneously. This works most efficiently if the code does not contain long dependency chains.
