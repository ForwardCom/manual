\subsubsection{Features of softcore model A version 1.01}
\begin{itemize}
\item Runs on Nexys A7-100T FPGA board
\item Maximum clock frequency 50 - 70 MHz, depending on configuration
\item 32-bit or 64-bit registers
\item Can execute one instruction per clock cycle
\item Data memory 32 kB. Code memory 64 kB. Call stack 1023 entries.
\item Implements all application-level integer instructions
\item Implements all instruction formats and all addressing modes defined by the ForwardCom standard version 1.12.
\item No vector registers yet. No floating point instructions
\item No system calls, no memory protection. Useful for embedded designs
\item Memory reads and writes must be aligned
\item RS232 serial interface for standard input and output
\item On-chip loader (uses 1 kB code memory)
\item On-chip debug interface
\item On-chip event counter
\item Code examples and test suite provided
\end{itemize}
